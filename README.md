This is the node rewrite of my website.

## What I'm doing
For a while now, my website has been done in Django. It's time for
a rewrite.

## What I'm using
1. Node
2. express
3. passport
4. mongoose
5. mongodb
6. react
7. bootstrap
8. vanilla js
9. mocha/chai
10. test driven development

## Why I'm using that stuff
No other reason than it's fun to work with and it helps me stay
fresh with stuff I'm currently using at work.
